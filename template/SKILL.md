# SKILL_NAME

One-line framing: what CLI/tool this drives and the role it plays.

## Mental model (read this first)

The 2–3 things that bite. Be concrete and empirical.

## Quick reference

| Need | Where |
| ---- | ----- |
| Detail X | [reference.md → X](reference.md#x) |

## 1. Parse the invocation

How `key=value` options + free-form task are parsed.

## 2. Pre-flight

What to check before firing (paths exist, auth, etc.).

## 3. Build the command

The role → command table.

## 4. Run & capture

Output shape; how to capture the answer; long-run handling.

## 5. After it runs

Attribute, verify with `git` not prose, continue/resume.

## Failure notes

Common errors and their fixes. Link the shared safety contract: [docs/safety.md](../../docs/safety.md).
